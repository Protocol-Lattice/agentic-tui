# 🌌 Lattice Code — Terminal AI Coding Environment

**Lattice Code** is a next-generation **AI coding terminal** powered by the **Protocol Lattice** ecosystem.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 AI Agents for Software Creation

* **Coder** — feature implementation, testing, and iteration
* **Reviewer** — code analysis, optimization, and suggestions

### 🔌 UTCP Tool Integration

Discover and run external tools (MCP/UTCP providers) directly inside the TUI —
or invoke them inline with `@utcp` commands.

### 🗂️ Interactive Directory Navigation

Choose your working directory through a navigable filesystem selector.

Extracts code blocks (` ```go ... ``` ` etc.) from AI output and saves them to your workspace.
